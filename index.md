## About Me
I’m a research scientist at [Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r).  Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UCL’s Intelligent Systems Group, supervised by Prof. [Massimiliano Pontil](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Pontil/). I completed my Ph.D. in machine learning at Imperial College, supervised by [Prof. Yiannis Demiris](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.demiris) and Prof. [Carlo Ciliberto](https://cciliber.github.io/). I was funded by [Singapore National Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/For-Graduate-Studies/National-Science-Scholarship-PhD).

## Research Interests
I have broad interests in topics of machine learning, including representation learning, meta-learning, and imitation learning. The goal of my research is to create robust ML systems that could efficiently leverage past experiences and existing knowledge for future tasks.
