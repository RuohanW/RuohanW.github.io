## About Me


I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UCL, supervised by Prof. [Massimiliano Pontil](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Pontil/) and an applied scientist intern at AWS Berlin, mentored by Dr. [Cedric Archambeau](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.archambeau/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Imperial College London, with supervision from [Prof. Yiannis Demiris](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.demiris) and Prof. [Carlo Ciliberto](https://cciliber.github.io/), and was supported by the [Singapore National Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/For-Graduate-Studies/National-Science-Scholarship-PhD).

## Research Interests
My research spans a range of machine learning topics, including representation learning, meta-learning, continual learning, and imitation learning. My primary aim is to develop robust ML systems that efficiently leverage existing model knowledge to address novel tasks and are capable of continuous improvements.
