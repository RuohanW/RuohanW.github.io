## Bio
I'm a fourth-year PhD student at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Professor [Yiannis Demiris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B2o5i-AAAAAJ&hl=en). I'm from Singapore, funded by [Singapore National Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/For-Graduate-Studies/National-Science-Scholarship-PhD). Prior to studying for a PhD, I have worked as a software developer and attempted startup.

My research interest is machine learning and robotics. Specifically, I have worked on imtation learning, and meta-learning such that intelligent agents could learn from human behaviors and quickly adapt to individual people.
